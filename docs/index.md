# LIMIT Language

**LIMIT** is a minimalist programming language and transpiler designed as a **DSL for extensibility and powerful programming for beginners**. Whether you're building educational tools, exploring compiler theory, or designing custom interfaces, LIMIT offers a simple but expressive foundation.

## Why LIMIT?

- **Clarity-first syntax** — prefix-style expressions and block-scoped logic
- **Customizable** — remap tokens, build domain-specific interfaces
- **Fast feedback loop** — REPL and file execution
- **Multi-target transpilation** — currently supports Python; future targets: C, JavaScript, WASM, LLVM
- **100% test coverage** — all features covered by strict, reproducible test suites

## Features at a Glance

- Custom handwritten parser (no parser generators)
- Human-readable abstract syntax tree (AST)
- Function and class support with full control flow
- TRY/CATCH/FINALLY, modularity, import/export
- Transpiler system with pluggable emitters
- A REPL for interactive experimentation
- Built-in aliasing for symbolic or word-based syntax
